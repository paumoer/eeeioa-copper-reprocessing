# Environmental and socioeconomic impacts of increased reprocessing of copper in Germany
This study analyzes the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of increased copper reprocessing in Germany using Environmental Input-Output Analysis. The research was conducted by three group members as part of an advanced course in environmentally extended Input-Output Analysis. While the findings have been thoroughly reviewed, no guarantees are made regarding their scientific or methodological accuracy. However, the project was awarded a very good grade.

### Research Project Summary

This study investigates the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of increasing copper reprocessing in Germany using **Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis (EEIOA)**. Copper is a critical raw material with growing demand, particularly for renewable energy and electronic applications. Enhancing recycling and circular economy strategies can reduce environmental footprints while ensuring a stable supply.  

The research utilizes the **EXIOBASE 3.0** multi-regional input-output database, which includes 49 regions, 169 industries, and various environmental indicators. A **baseline scenario** is established to assess current copper flows and impacts, followed by a **counterfactual scenario** simulating increased secondary copper processing in Germany. The counterfactual scenario was applied by modifying the demand in the **technical coefficient matrix (A Matrix)** (industry-by-industry). By applying the **Leontief inverse** the total output required to meet the given final demand can be computed. The emission intensities have been calculated with the production-based approach (PBA). Key impact categories analyzed include **greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption, water use, and employment**.  

Findings indicate that increasing copper reprocessing in Germany leads to **lower GHG emissions, reduced energy consumption, and decreased water use** compared to primary copper production. However, employment in the sector declines, contradicting the hypothesis that increased recycling would boost job creation. This suggests that while circular economy strategies provide clear environmental benefits, they may also lead to structural shifts in the labor market.  

To apply the changes to the sector of copper reprocessing different assumptions had to be made which highly influence the validity of the results. The main assumptions were:
- Secondary raw copper quality is equal to primary raw copper quality.
- Overall quantity of raw (primary and secondary) material consumed remains constant.
- Increased copper reprocessing benefits only the local (German) production.
- Copper manufacturing is performed solely reallocated to German copper production.
- Increased scrap collection may lead to exports rather than domestic utilization. 

The study underscores the importance of **policy interventions**, technological advancements, and further research to maximize the benefits of copper circularity. Future work could explore additional circular strategies, such as product lifetime extension and improved material efficiency, to optimize both environmental and socioeconomic outcomes.
